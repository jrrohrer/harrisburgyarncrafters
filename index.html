      <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a meetup group for knitters, crocheters, cross-stitchers, and anyone else who wants to craft with yarn in a social setting. The goal of our group is to support each other's crafty endeavors while fostering friendship.</p>
      <p>If you are new to yarn-crafting, we strongly suggest you check out some how-to videos on YouTube before you come hang out. Since we're a social group, we don't do any formal teaching. But we will be happy to answer questions, help you figure out a new technique, or point you towards the best local yarn shops!</p>
      <p>We have a consistent meeting schedule. We get together on the first Tuesday and Third Thursday every month at 7pm. Prior to the pandemic, we were meeting at the Panera Bread on Jonestown Road. We certainly hope to get back to meeting in person in the future, but for now we meet on Zoom.</p>
